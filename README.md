## About
As an otherwise traditional software engineer with some rather prehistoric academic experience with AI/ML, I've recently had to upgrade my skills with the now more-than-mainStream NL Web and Agentification of the internet. 
This is a summary of my own learning within the past few years and has served well for me as a bridge between the traditional programming paradigms and the new Agentic paradigm.
I find myself referring back to this material often as a programmer and an architect and hope it may be of some use to others in similar roles.
Any additional comments or edits for accuracy or improvements are most welcome.
